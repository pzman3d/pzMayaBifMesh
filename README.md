pzMayaBifMesh

This is a tool in MAYA that uses Bifrost Graph to read Alembic sequence files and convert them into regular meshes. With this tool, MAYA can read Alembic sequence files, allowing various rendering engines to render them without worrying about the issue of unsupported Bifrost objects, such as REDSHIFT.

這是一個在MAYA中利用Bifrost Graph讀取Alembic序列檔案,轉換成普通mesh的工具.
透過這個工具能讓MAYA讀取Alembic序列檔案,能讓各種算圖引擎算圖,不須擔心不支援Bifrost物件問題,例如REDSHIFT等算圖引擎.
